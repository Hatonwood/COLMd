# COLMd

This project was meant to do something!

# Well

Have you ever been on edge knowing what your next episode was were tired of opening some random document with all your show's episode numbers

Hell yeah man, COLM'd is so light even it doesn't feel itself. Seriously it IS Light and Fast *blink* Maybe it turns out to be even faster in the future.

#The project is going back and forth even though I get more interest in it every single time

The current status is:

Reading data from file and store it in the COLMed Class so the application takes the status from where it was last executed
